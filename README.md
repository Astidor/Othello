# Othello
This C++ code implements a simple artificial intelligence (AI) for playing the game of Reversi (also known as Othello)
It is a classic board game for two players. The game is played on an 8x8 grid board, typically with two contrasting colors, usually black and white. Each player controls pieces of their color, with the objective of having the majority of their colored pieces showing at the end of the game.
